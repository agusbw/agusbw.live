        Greetings, world! Allow me to introduce myself: Nyoman Agus Budhiarta
        Waisnawa, but you can call me Bewe. I&apos;m a passionate software
        developer, specializing in cutting-edge web technologies and website
        development.

        My journey into the world of coding began in 2020 when I stumbled upon a
        captivating programming video. I vividly remember the thrill of creating
        my first project, a Python-based tic-tac-toe game. While I&apos;ll admit
        that I leaned heavily on video tutorials at the time (ðŸ˜‚), the sense of
        accomplishment I felt was immense. Since then, my fascination with
        coding has persisted, particularly in the realm of frontend development.
      </p>
      <p>
        At present, I&apos;m pursuing a degree in Institut Teknologi & Bisnis
        STIKOM Bali. My daily routine revolves around completing college
        assignments and embarking on personal projects that pique my interest.
        Beyond coding, I love devouring technology articles, staying active on
        social media, and cherishing quality time spent with my loved ones.
