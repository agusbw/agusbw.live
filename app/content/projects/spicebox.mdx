## Description

This project is a fullstack web application project built using React as the frontend library and [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) as the backend service. This Poject has a goal to help users search for recipes and share recipes with others.

## Features

- User authentication (login and register)
- Generate random recipes based on user spesific food criterias
- Manage user recipes (create, read, update and delete recipe)
- Search for public recipes from other users with the necessary filters and search keyword
- Feature save recipes to bookmarks for users
- User profile management

## Final words

In this project I learned a lot because I handled both Front-End and Back-End even though I used Backend-as-a-Service. I encountered several challenges such as determining what key features that user needs, how to create a consistent UI appearance, and handling user authentication.
