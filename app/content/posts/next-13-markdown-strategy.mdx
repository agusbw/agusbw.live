## Introduction

In this blog post, I'll explain about the markdown strategy that I use in making this website. This website was created using the NextJS Framework version 13 (app router) where static content management on this website such as blogs and projects uses markdown format. In the next section, I'll explain the details about the library I use and how it works.

## Markdown Library

On this website, I use the [`next-mdx-remote`](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote) library to handle markdown, the selection of this library is based on several things, namely:

1. `next-mdx-remote` already supports react server component really well (atleast on my use case).
2. Accessing frontmatter can be done easily.
3. It can access markdown on external sources, this is necessary when we want to put markdown outside of our website such as when we want to put markdown in a different Github repository and want to access it using REST API.

## How it Works

In this section I'll explain how I manage `.mdx` files in my application, access content and frontmatter, styling content, and create custom components for markdown elements.

### MDX files location

You can put `.mdx` files anywhere in your project directory, but on this website all `.mdx` files are placed in the `/app/content` folder as shown above.

### Accessing frontmatter and content

To be able to access frontmatter and content from files outside MDX, we can take advantage of the `compileMDX` method from `next-mdx-remote`. Here is the code example.

```js
// @/lib/mdx/post.js
import fs from "fs";
import path from "path";
import { compileMDX } from "next-mdx-remote/rsc";

//get root directory of your mdx files
const rootDirectory = path.join(process.cwd(), "app", "content", "posts");

export const getPostBySlug = async (slug) => {
  const realSlug = slug.replace(/\.mdx$/, "");
  const filePath = path.join(rootDirectory, `${realSlug}.mdx`);
  const fileContent = fs.readFileSync(filePath, { encoding: "utf8" });

  const { frontmatter, content } = await compileMDX({
    source: fileContent,
    options: {
      parseFrontmatter: true,
    },
  });

  return { meta: { ...frontmatter, slug: realSlug }, content };
};
```

In the example above, I created a `getPostBySlug` function that returns metadata and content from the post. Frontmatter and content in the return value I got from the compileMDX method. **Note that compileMDX is an asynchronous method**

Now, your frontmatter and MDX content can be accessed from any component using those functions, both client and server components. Here is an example of accessing it on a server component in NextJS 13.

```jsx
import { redirect } from "next/navigation";
import { getPostBySlug } from "@/lib/mdx/post";
const Page = async ({ params }) => {
  let post;
  try {
    post = await getPostBySlug(params.slug);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
    redirect("/");
  }
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{post.meta.title}</h1>
      <div>{post.content}</div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Styling content and custom components

#### Using Tailwind CSS plugin

In my opinion, the fastest way to style compiled markdown elements is to use the `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin, with this plugin, you can set typography styling on your markdown elements by setting custom CSS variables in `tailwind.config.js`, then wrapping the element with the "prose" class (class from `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin), so the styling of the markdown content will be applied automatically based on your plugin customization.

```html
<div className="prose">{post.content}</div>
```

For further customization, you can refer to the plugin documentation [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin) .

#### Using custom component

In some cases, TailwindCSS typography plugin may not be enough for your needs, if you are faced with it or you don't use TailwindCSS and still want to customize your markdown elements, you can take advantage of the custom component feature provided by `next-mdx-remote`.

Here is an example of its implementation :

```jsx

// @/lib/mdx/mdx-components.jsx
import { AiOutlineLink } from "react-icons/ai";
import MarkdownHeaderLink from "@/components/shared/markdown-header-link";

const components = {
	// put all your custom components here
	h2: (props) => (
		<MarkdownHeaderLink headingId={props.id}>
			<div className="flex items-center gap-2">
				<AiOutlineLink className="text-2xl text-lowContrast" />
				<h2 {...props} />
			</div>
		</MarkdownHeaderLink>
		),
	};
}

export default components;
```

```jsx
const { frontmatter, content } = await compileMDX({
  source: fileContent,
  options: {
    parseFrontmatter: true,
  },
  components, //your custom components
});
```

Pass the custom components when you use the `compileMDX` method, so that each `h2` element in the content will be replaced with the custom components that you have created.

## Final Words

That's how I applied markdown to Next13 using the `next-mdx-remote` plugin, remember that this method is not solely the most correct way but only the way I personally use. Use ways and plugins that are more effective in your opinion according to the project you create.
